List Reversal :
	In list_reversal program, sir had not mentioned the termination case 
	means the truth statement so it was giving an error while compiling.
	Then I added just the terminal case when single element is present
	and formed the program list_reversal_error.pl which has logical error
	in it , so it gives wrong output. For example reverse_list([1,2,3],X). 
	gives [3,3|3] as output and reverse_list([1,2,3,4],X). gives [4,4,4|4]
	
	Then I wrote the list_reversal.pl program which is the correct version to
	reverse a list. reverse_list([1,2,3],X). returns [3,2,1] which is correct.
	
	
Kth Element :
	In this program there was a slight error in logic that instead of kth
	element it was returning (k+1)th element.  So i changed the program a 
	bit and instead of starting the count from 0 , I started the count from 1
	which corrected the program. Instead of kthfind([A|L],K,E,0). , 
	I wrote kthfind([A|L],K,E,1). which started the initial count from 1.
	For example in sir program kth([a,b,c],1,X). was giving b 
	but in my prograam the same thing gives a which is the correct answer
	
Sibling :
	In the first sibling program there was small error in logic that was 
	considering a weird fact that Everyone is his/her own sibling which is
	not correct . So output was like harry,harry are siblings
	But the 2nd program resolved this issue by using X/=Y that is only when
	X and Y are not equal which gave only the correct outputs.
	
Path Connections :
	In 2nd program when we write connected(A,B):-connected(B,A),!.  
	and run connected(delhi,chennai). it is giving infinite recursion
	So the path_connection2.pl is an example of infinite recursion.
	But when we check directly connected regions , it gives true. 
	But we can correct the infinite recursion using ; operator which I 
	have written the program as path_connection3.pl which is correct one.
