For improvements, I took the code of 15 puzzle game ..
Not much changes were possible , but i made most of the
improvements that I could..........

In old program I was using two extra variables in a and b 
for mentioning the x and y coordinate of the buttons
but in new program , I removed those variables and used
the variab;es i snd j used in loop control to mention the
x and y coordinates of the button.

I was also doing redundant checking by using simple if statement
Instead in new program , I made the use of if-else-if ladder
to stop any un-necessary checks of the conditions

I also combined many conditional checks by sing the and(&&) operator
and or(||) operator.

I was writing some common lines during condition checking again and again
Instead I created a boolean variable which is initially set to false 
but is turned true if the condition becomes true and finally 
if the condition is true , I did the essential tasks ehich can be better
understood if You compare both the programs.
