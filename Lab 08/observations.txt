In str2int.cpp i used assert statement to check if length function is greater than zero
Actually i just wanted to ensure that length is not zero
Then I mentioned two assert statements whose function is to check 
if the string entered has only numbers or not which lie in the ASCII code range of
48 to 57 both inclusive.

In substring.cpp I used first assert statement to compare the lengths
because of length of string iss less than substring then there is no
need to search for the substring in the parent string
I used 2nd assert statement to check that location does not go out of max possible value

In collection.cpp I used cap == sz because cap was used to store the capacity 
of the collection......Then I used card < cap because we can not store more
numbers than the declared capacity.......Then i used card>0 because cardinality cannot be negative 
and if cardinality is 0 , then no element is present to be popped out.

If any changes will be there , I will submit them in improvements tab....
as now lightning is going on....so i cant use laptop any more for safety purposes
