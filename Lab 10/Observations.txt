Line no 4 is used to open the file in read only mode
then we used c = dict() to create an empty dictionary
We used for line in text_file to loop through each line of the text file
line = line.strip() is used to remove the leading spaces and newline character
Then we convert all the wors into lowercase to avoid confusion
Then we split the line into words and then loop through each word
if word is already present in dictionary then we increase its count by one
else we add the word to the dictionary and initialize its count to one
Then we used the last for loop to print all the words present in dictionary
and the respective frequency of occurence of each word present
