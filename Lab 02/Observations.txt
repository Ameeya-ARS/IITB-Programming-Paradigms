In the last program that I had submitted , it was the program of a very basic lift that would just take one person 
reach the destination and then would consider the request of another person.

But the program that I am submitting now , I tried to make as much improvement as possible
From the internet I learned many new concepts of programming such as vector , different functions of vector
I also tried to learn how to implement coordination between different objects of a class
I also learned how to extract words from a space separated string line and the use of cin.ignore()

But I also could not include a few concepts such as my program does not consider the up and down button , 
it directly takes the floor request from outside and automatically detects whether it is up or down
For the limiting condition of lift, I considered the number of passengers and not their weight. Later I will
surely try to incorporate the up and down button and the functioning of two lifts.

####################### EXPLANATION OF THE WORKING OF PROGRAM ##############################

set_request() function takes the input from the people waiting at a floor (both one or many)
in a string format where the different floor requests are separated by a space. I used getline
instead of cin because the string input would consist of spaces. Then if the request reads GO,
that means either no ene would enter the lift from that floor or if the lift is already empty 
then the program would terminate. Otherwise I extracted single floor from the list of floors , 
and checked the validity of the request. A request would be invalid in 3 cases :
      a. If lift is moving UPWARD and person wants to go DOWNWARD
      b. If lift is moving DOWNWARD and person wants to go UPWARD
      c. If person enters a floor number greater than max or smaller than min
If the request is considered valid then the request is stored in the vector.
The safety condition is also checked if the no of passengers are less than the maximun
capacity of the lift.


verify_request() function takes floor number as an argument and returns either 
1 or 2 or 3 or 4 depending upon the condition mentioned in the comments of program


is_request_valid() function calls the verify_request() function with floor as an
arguments and displays the error message representing 1 or 2 or 3 in above function


set_direction() function takes floor as an argument and says whether the lift has to 
move in UPWARD or DOWNWARD direction 


start_lift() is the most important part of the program
It first calls the set_request() to take the input , then it sorts the floor requests
made in ascending order by using a sort function nd then by using vectors , it keeps on updating 
the next_floor and the current_floor. It also keeps a record of no of passengers who move
out of the lift and no of passengers left in lift. When it reaches a floor , it removes all the
requests of he current floor and subsequently subtracts the no of passengers exit.


main() function is used to take the input from the user about various data such as
maximum floor number, minimum floor number , capacity of the lift and and call the 
constructor in order to initialize the constant variables. Then it calls the start_lift()
function the functioning of the program starts.
