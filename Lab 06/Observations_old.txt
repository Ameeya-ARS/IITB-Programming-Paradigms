I tried to understand the different parts of your given program
and i also tried to move the shape using arrow keys
and i was also able to do so..........
I was trying to make a simple game like snake game
in which my plan was that a square will eat the circles which
will increase score and eating any other shape will give  negative
score but i was not able to figure out how if two shapes were overlapping
as i was using rand() function , so i am submitting my half written code
I will surely to try to implement my game and submit in the later
improvements tab as my head is paining and i am not able to sit
infront of laptop for that reason
