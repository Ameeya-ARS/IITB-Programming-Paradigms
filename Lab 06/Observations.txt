I tried to create a simple game but i got segmentation fault.
I tried to fix the error but could not fix it after many attempts
I am submitting the code but i will keep trying to fix the
error that is causing segmentation fault to the best of my efforts.

Now when the date was extended I was able to find the cause of
segmentation fault and fixed that.....But my game is much simple 
Left click is used to jump and right click is used to move forward
Task is to jump over all the blocks successfully
I could not implement much features to the game because after the
midsem, my health was not OK and I was having fever and headache
So I submitted what I could do to the best of my efforts.

Sorry but I was also not able to click a screenshot of the game....
