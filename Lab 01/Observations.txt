In 1st lab , I was not able to understand the difference between the two types of program
now I understood how to use class() and public and private access specifiers properly.

In 1st question, I made some improvements as listed below:-
    1. Earlier I had not used srand(), but now understood the meaning of srand() and included it
    2. I also understood the meaning of time(0) which is used to create different seeding every time, so I included it now
    3. I also organized my function by using proper indentation and giving sufficient comments in beginning and in betwwen the program
    4. Earlier I was not able to use the access specifiers properly, now I used both public and private in program1.cpp
    5. Earlier I was not printing the random numbers generated but now I am printing all the numbers generated by random no generator
These were the improvements in the 1st question of Lab.

For the 2nd question, I had submiited the incomplete wrong file as I was not able to solve the problem
But now I have solved it and submitting the correct code for 2nd question 

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROCEDURAL & OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
   1. In PROCEDURAL programming , program is divided into small parts called functions whereas 
      in OBJECT ORIENTED programming, program is divided into small parts called objects.
   2. PROCEDURAL programming does not have any proper way for hiding data so it is less secure
      but OBJECT ORIENTED programming provides data hiding so it is more secure.
   3. In PROCEDURAL programming, overloading is not possible whereas
      Overloading is possible in OBJECT ORIENTED programming.
