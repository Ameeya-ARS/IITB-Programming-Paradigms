Today you will learn to use assertions to trap errors while developing code

Given bad code, you have to:

either work with faulty code given for a function, or if the function is empty,

write your own faulty logic in it and then....

(1) write main which will expose errors (badness in code)==> segmentation fault, core dump.

(2) design assertions which will catch all errors in the program.

==> error in main disappears, and assertion fails instead!



submit observations along with modified code with assertions

Experiment with assert and have fun !
